## Engineering Code Test
a command line application written in python3 :
#
Test by running `test.sh` in the root directory
#
    sh test.sh


Run `print_solution.py` at the root to generate an output
#
    python3 print_solution.py
#
### Notable helper functions:
- `utilities/open_file`: reads files and outputs an array of lines

    #

        - last_name, first_name, gender, favorite_color, date_of_birth
        - last_name | first_name | middle_initial | gender| favorite_color | date_of_birth
        - last_name first_name middle_initial gender date_of_birth favorite_color

- `utilities/sanitize`: cleans data and outputs correct format.
    #					
        last_name first_name gender date_of_birth favorite_color

-  `utilities/generate_output`: sorts the data in 3 different ways to generate `solution`'s output:
    #
    1. sorted by gender and last name ascending:
        #   
            Output1:
